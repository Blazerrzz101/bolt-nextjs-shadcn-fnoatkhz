## Current Task: Fix "self is not defined" Error for Vercel Deployment

### Summary of the Issue
The Supabase client library attempts to use the global variable `self`, which is not defined in Node.js environments like Vercel. This causes deployment errors when trying to build the application.

### Solution Implemented
We created a comprehensive solution with several components:

1. **Polyfill Library** (`lib/polyfills.js`):
   - Creates global objects like `self`, `window`, and `navigator` if they don't exist
   - Exposes a helper function `ensurePolyfills()` that can be called to verify they're working

2. **Supabase Safe Client** (`lib/supabase-safe-client.js`):
   - Wraps Supabase client initialization with proper error handling
   - Checks for mock mode and provides alternative implementation when needed
   - Handles both server and client environments safely

3. **API Wrapper** (`lib/api-wrapper.js`):
   - Provides utility functions for API routes
   - Includes wrappers for handlers that ensure polyfills are applied
   - Provides consistent success and error response formats

4. **Vercel Entry Point** (`scripts/vercel-entry.js`):
   - Sets up polyfills at the very beginning of the build process
   - Exports a verification function to ensure polyfills are properly set up

5. **API Route Updates**:
   - Created scripts to update and fix API routes to use our wrapper pattern
   - Ensures all API routes import polyfills at the top
   - Wraps handler functions with `withPolyfills` and `withStaticBuildHandler`

6. **Vercel Configuration**:
   - Updated vercel.json to use our custom build script
   - Added NODE_OPTIONS to include the entry point polyfill in all Node.js processes
   - Set environment variables for mock mode during builds

7. **Deployment Script** (`scripts/deploy-polyfilled.sh`):
   - Combines all the fixes into a single deployment flow
   - Includes verification steps to ensure everything is properly set up
   - Provides a seamless deployment experience that handles the error

### Lessons Learned
1. Supabase client library assumes browser globals are available
2. Node.js SSR environments need polyfills for browser globals like `self`
3. Polyfills must be loaded before any Supabase code runs
4. Use of dynamic imports can help control the order of code execution
5. Robust error handling is essential for proper fallbacks in different environments
6. Mock data implementations are critical for testing and development
7. A comprehensive deployment script improves reliability

### Next Steps
1. Deploy the application using the new polyfilled deployment script
2. Verify all functionality is working on the deployed site
3. Document the solution in the project README for future reference
4. Consider adding more tests to ensure the polyfill solution continues to work

   - Increased upvote count from 5 to 6
   - Set vote type to 1
   - Updated score from 3 to 4

2. **Toggling an upvote**:
   - Successfully removed the upvote
   - Decreased upvote count from 6 to 5
   - Set vote type to null
   - Updated score from 4 to 3

3. **Downvoting a product**:
   - Successfully added a downvote
   - Increased downvote count from 2 to 3
   - Set vote type to -1
   - Updated score from 3 to 2

4. **Toggling a downvote**:
   - Successfully removed the downvote
   - Decreased downvote count from 3 to 2
   - Set vote type to null
   - Updated score from 2 to 3

All vote actions were properly reflected in the vote status checks, confirming that the voting system is working correctly.
