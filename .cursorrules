# Lessons
## User Specified Lessons
- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- Implement proper error handling in the API to ensure consistent responses even when unexpected conditions occur
- When working with Next.js static assets, use MiniCssExtractPlugin to properly handle CSS in production builds
- Create pre-build check scripts to verify all necessary files and dependencies exist before building

- Implement health check systems to verify all API endpoints are working properly
- Create production startup scripts to ensure all required data is available and valid before starting the server
- When deploying Supabase applications to Vercel or other Node.js environments, handle the "self is not defined" error by creating polyfills for browser globals
- Create a custom Supabase client wrapper that handles both server and client environments safely
- Use the withPolyfills wrapper pattern to ensure all API routes properly handle server-side rendering
- Add polyfill imports at the top of API route files to ensure they're loaded first
- Use a custom Vercel entry point script to ensure polyfills are loaded early in the build process
- Add the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable to include polyfill setup in all Node.js processes
- Create scripts to automatically update and fix API routes to use the proper wrapper pattern
- Implement helper functions for creating consistent API responses across the application
- Use proper TypeScript type checking for error objects by using instanceof Error checks
- Implement feature flags through environment variables to enable easy toggling of features in different environments
- When facing deployment issues with Next.js, consider creating a minimalist version using App Router and avoiding external dependencies
- Use inline styles instead of CSS modules or Tailwind when creating a simple deployable version to avoid compilation issues
- Implement client-side authentication with cookies for simple admin access when external auth services aren't available
- Create mock API endpoints with in-memory data storage for quick prototyping
- Use Vercel configuration to add security headers without requiring custom server code
- Deploy to specific regions for better performance with the regions setting in vercel.json
- Provide comprehensive deployment documentation including access credentials and next steps
- When creating deployment scripts, use interactive prompts to allow user decision points during the process
- Include validation checks in deployment scripts to ensure environment is properly configured
- Create separate verification scripts to ensure all components are working post-deployment
