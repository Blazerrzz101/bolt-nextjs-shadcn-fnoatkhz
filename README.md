## Voting System

The application includes a robust voting system that allows users to upvote or downvote products. The voting system has the following features:

### Features

- Anonymous voting using client IDs stored in localStorage
- Upvote and downvote functionality
- Toggle votes by clicking the same button again
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Proper error handling and fallbacks
- Real-time vote count updates

### Implementation

The voting system is implemented using the following components:

1. **VoteButtons Component**: A reusable component that displays upvote and downvote buttons with counts.
   ```tsx
   // Using with product ID only
   <VoteButtons productId="550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" />
   
   // Using with product object
   <VoteButtons product={product} />
   
   // Customizing appearance
   <VoteButtons 
     product={product} 
     size="sm" 
     variant="ghost" 
     className="my-custom-class" 
   />
   ```

2. **useVote Hook**: A custom hook that provides vote functionality and state management.
   ```tsx
   const { vote, checkUserVote, isLoading, clientId } = useVote();
   
   // Check if user has voted
   const voteType = await checkUserVote(productId);
   
   // Cast a vote (1 for upvote, -1 for downvote)
   const result = await vote(product, 1);
   ```

3. **API Routes**:
   - `GET /api/vote`: Retrieves vote counts and user vote status
     ```
     /api/vote?productId=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000&clientId=anonymous
     ```
   - `POST /api/vote`: Casts or removes votes
     ```json
     {
       "productId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
       "voteType": 1,
       "clientId": "anonymous"
     }
     ```

### Database Structure

Votes are stored in the `votes` table with the following structure:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the vote
- `product_id`: The product being voted on
- `vote_type`: 1 for upvote, -1 for downvote
- `metadata`: JSONB column containing client_id for anonymous users
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the vote was created
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the vote was last updated

Products table includes the following vote-related fields:
- `upvotes`: Count of upvotes
- `downvotes`: Count of downvotes
- `score`: Calculated as upvotes - downvotes

### Client ID Generation

For anonymous users, a client ID is generated and stored in localStorage:

```js
// Generate a unique client ID
const generateClientId = () => {
  return `${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2)}_${Date.now()}`;
};

// Get or create client ID
const getClientId = () => {
  let clientId = localStorage.getItem('tierd_client_id');
  if (!clientId) {
    clientId = generateClientId();
    localStorage.setItem('tierd_client_id', clientId);
  }
  return clientId;
};
```

### Maintenance

The voting system includes a maintenance script to fix inconsistent vote counts:

```bash
# Check for inconsistencies (dry run)
node scripts/fix-vote-counts.js --dry-run

# Fix all products
node scripts/fix-vote-counts.js

# Fix a specific product
node scripts/fix-vote-counts.js --product-id=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

### Testing

The voting system can be tested using the test page at `/test-vote`, which provides a UI for testing various voting scenarios:

- Testing the VoteButtons component
- Direct API calls for voting and checking votes
- Testing with different client IDs

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Vote counts not updating**: Run the fix-vote-counts script to recalculate counts based on actual votes.

2. **Client ID issues**: Clear localStorage and refresh the page to generate a new client ID.

3. **API errors**: Check the browser console for detailed error messages. Most common issues are related to missing or invalid parameters.
